        Attack on Titan is a Japanese manga series created by Hajime Isayama.
        The story is set in a world where humanity resides within enormous
        walled cities to protect themselves from the Titans, gigantic humanoid
        creatures that devour humans seemingly without reason. The narrative
        follows Eren Yeager and his friends who join the military to fight the
        Titans after their hometown is destroyed. As the story unfolds, it
        explores themes of survival, freedom, and the mysteries behind the
        origin of the Titans.
